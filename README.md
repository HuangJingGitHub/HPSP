# HPSP
Core modules of **h**omotopic **p**ath **s**et **p**lanning (HPSP), especially the module of passage-aware optimal path planning based on sampling-based planners. It is in active development.
## Requirements
We use ROS to organize the project, but the code should also be compilable independently. Other libraries include OpenCV for visualization and Eigen for computation.
